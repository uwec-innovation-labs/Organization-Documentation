# React Project Structure

With React, we want to focus on modularity and reusability. We will be taking a page from Chemistry by following something called Atomic Design Methodology.

Resources for this can be found here: http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/

## Basic Understanding

Here is a breakdown of how React components will be organized. This may change as we find better ways of organizing.

```
- frontend
    - public
    - components
        - atoms
        - molecules
        - organisms
        - templates
    - scripts
    app.js
    app.css
    index.js
    index.css
```

The frontend will consist of other files and folders as part of React, but we want to focus on this components folder (which you will have to create in a new project, along with the folders within it!).
