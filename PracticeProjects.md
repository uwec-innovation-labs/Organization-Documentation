# Project Ideas
These are not unique ideas, but hopefully will give you enough of a start where you can add your own flair to it. So, try to think outside of the box and add a spin to it or even try and combine a few!


## Frontend Ideas
For the frontend, just build the static pages. This may require a little bit of hardcoding, but try not to use a backend.

- CampS, but Better
- Social Media Profile
- Startup Landing Page
- News Homepage
- Blog Post
- Meme Generator
- Statistical Dashboard (Hint: ChartJS or D3.js)
- Note Taking Application
- Idea Board
- Fake Bank Account
- Audio Visualizer (Hint: p5.js)
- Pomodoro Timer
- Magic 8 Ball
- Airline Tickets
- Remake the School Website
 
## Backend Ideas
For the backend, don't hook it up to the frontend. Everything should be accessible through a RESTful API.

- Discord Bot
- Basic CRUD Endpoints
- Return Data from an API
- Return Data from a Database (Hint: MongoDB)
- Web Scraper
- Movie Picker
- Serverside Rendering HTML
- Authentication (Hint: Passport +  JWTTokens)

## Full-stack Ideas
These ideas are going to be bigger in scope as it will be both the frontend and the backend. Do this, if you want to build it all.

- Persistent Task List
- Discord/Slack Clone
- Tic-Tac-Toe (Hint: Socket.io)
- Account Creation / Login
- Voting Application
- Quote of the Day
- Forums
- A Desktop Application with React (Hint: Electron)
