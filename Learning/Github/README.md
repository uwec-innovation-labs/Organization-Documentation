# Learning to use Github

This is a helpful document for learning the basics of github. I also recommend Googling github questions as it will probably be much faster and extensive than what this will be. This will just help get you started with the basics and include some resources. We will assume you have Github account already (so set one up if you haven't!). Also, be sure to check out the Github Student Developer Pack for a bunch of cool things: https://education.github.com/pack

## Creating a Github Repository

I always recommend going to the organization or your account and clicking the + button in the top right to setup the repository using the friendly UI with all the proper settings, README, License, and .gitignore all generated.
