This guide contains the recommended path to learn the backend stack at Innovation Labs! This is only a recommendation, so feel free to take whatever path you feel will suite you best! If you find any helpful materials to the learning process along the way be sure to add them to this list!!

## Step 1 JavaScript!

The most helpful first step to this process will be learning JavaScript. Innovation Labs utilizes ES6 standard JavaScript across all of our platforms so starting here will get you moving in the right direction! Check out the following resources:

## Step 2 Node.JS

Our most commonly used tool for backend development is Node.JS! Node.JS is "an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications." - Node.JS All of our server side scripting and web application backends are written in Node.JS. As a note make sure any tutorials are the most up-to-date as possible, there are stark differences between different versions of Node! Check out the following resources:

## Step 3 Express

Congrats you are really moving!! Now onto Express!! Express is our tool of choice for our web applications; Express is a web framework for Node.JS used for creating and running our web servers! Check out the following resources:

## Step 4 GraphQL

GraphQL is the sword we use to fight the API battle! All of our API development will be done using GraphQL. "GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data." - GraphQL Check out the following resources:
