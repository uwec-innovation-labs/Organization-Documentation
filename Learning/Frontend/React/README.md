# Guide

This guide is only a recommendation of how to learn React. There are many ways to learn it. React is library created by Facebook which allows us to build components for the frontend. Its much more scalable and easier to maintain.

## Step 1: Learn JavaScript

You could definitly start by learning React, but you will likely struggle without a working knowledge of JavaScript. Understanding some of the syntax will go a long way in the learning process. Also, have knowledge of HTML and CSS as well, as they will also play a role within React.

## Step 2: Learn React

Now you are ready to learn about React, a powerful web framework used for the frontend. I recommend reading through the documentation, getting it installed on your computer, and playing around with it as you watch videos about it.

Resources:

- React Installation (React): https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
- React Documentation (React): https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html
- Learn React (Youtube): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0

## Step 3: Other Important Packages

With NPM, which is what you used to install react, you can actually install packages which makes certain things really easy. Here is a recommendation of a few you might use in the frontend. I will break them up by category. Note: A lot of these packages will have a site associated with them with documentation on how to use them.

When a package is installed its dependencies and itself are put in the node_modules folder.

### Design Frameworks

- Bootstrap: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap
- Material-UI: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core
- Reactstrap: https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactstrap

### Graphing

- Chart.js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/chartjs
- D3.js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3

### Requests

- Axios: https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
- GraphQL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql

### Cookies and LocalStorage

- Cookie: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie

### Sockets

- Socket.io: https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io

### Global State

- Redux: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux

### Desktop Builds

- Electron: https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron

### Mobile Builds

- React Native: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native

## Step 4: TypeScript and Continued Learning

The final recommended thing to look into is TypeScript. TypeScript basically makes JavaScript strongly typed and more Object-Oriented. Its tricky, but worth learning eventually. Other than that, there are so many more things to learn and to continue to learn as new things come out. Be curious and try out new things from time to time.
